#### It's friday morning, you're in class when your phone starts vibrating and the screen lights up. You look at the screen and it says "Bestfriend" You ask to get a drink of water.
----
#### You stare at the phone for a minute:
---
_You_: "What do you wantttttt?"

---
#### You swipe to accept, awaiting the annoying voice you just happen to hear everyday while walking to class in the hallways, you take a long sigh before saying..

---

 * _You_: "Hello?"
 * _Bestfriend_: "That party though!"
 * _You_: "Um, excuse me?"
 * _Bestfriend_: "The party."
 * _You_: "Listen, you're kinda calling me in the middle of class, so mind making this short and sweet before I get hollered at?"
 * _Bestfriend_: "Okay? I'm in Lunch and you dont see me hollering."
 * _You_: "Whatever."
 * _Bestfriend_: "Are you down?"
 * _You_:"For what?"
 * _Bestfriend_:"THE PARTY. ARE YOU DOWN YES OR NO?"
