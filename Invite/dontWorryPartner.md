You tell them you're going because you've had a stressful week and want to go and burn off steam. You say that it's just a party and there's nothing wrong with having  a little fun. You promise to be extra careful and not get into any problems. Your partner decides that they can't control you and tell you once more to be careful. You're friend chooses to call just as you end the call. She say's shes on her way and to wait outside for her arrival.
