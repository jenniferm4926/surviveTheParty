 * _Boyfriend/Girlfriend_: "Heard you were going to the party."
 * _You_: "Thanks for the hello."
 * _Boyfriend/Girlfriend_: "You know how wild it gets out there, I just dont want anything to happen, if something were to happen, I'm gonna be real upset because I'm always supposed to treat you like a parent! Don't go!"
