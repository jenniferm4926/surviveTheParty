#### Deciding to hell with it, it's friday night and staying in might be a decision you regret later.

 * _You_: "Fine. Are you gonna pick me up? or?"
 * _Bestfriend_: "Yeah, I got you. Just hurry up"
 * _You_: "Yeah, don't rush me"

-----

#### You get ready, and check yourself out before heading to the door to see your friend waiting there for you, you quickly enter the car and your friend starts speeding towards the party.

 * _You_: "Wanna not kill me?"
 * _Bestfriend_: "Bet."

_____

#### You arrive at the party before you are left in the front when your friend is conversating with a whole bunch of people you dont know. Should you wander by yourself or stick with a friend?
