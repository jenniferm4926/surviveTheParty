#### You sigh.. You defenitley arent in the mood for these random kids sleeping on your feet and loud music that can potentionally drop your hearing to about a 50%. You say..

 * _You_: "No.. that's not something I wanna do tonight, you know there's something I pay for every month like, I dont know, Netflix?"
 * _Bestfriend_: "You mean anti-social?"
 * _You_: "If that's being anti- social then I doubt you ever have enough time to your self."
 * _Bestfriend_: "Your loss. Talk to you later"

#### You hang up, and head into class before you can get hollered at.

#### During your daily netflix session, your phone vibrates quite loudly as you incline yourself to go up and get it. You look at the phone while displaying the words "Bestfriend" over the swipe to answer, wondering why you even have it as bestfriend anyways. You answer:

 * _You_: "Hey?"
 * _Bestfriend_: "Listen, the party starts in an hour and I have a quick and easy way to get in."
 * _You_: "Your version of quick and easy, is a quick and easy way to get into jail."
 * _Bestfriend_: "Wow, look at you, you know me so well!"
 * _You_: "Sneak in..?"
 * _Bestfriend_: "Yep, are you down, again?"
