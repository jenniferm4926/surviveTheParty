You sigh, typical party goers aren't really your plan for a fun night. You decide you're not in the mood for loud music and random stranger's stepping on your feet. The idea of having a movie marathon on netlfix sounds way more pleasing. You get to stay in pj's and at home! Right when you're getting into the movie, your phone starts vibrating. You pick it up and roll your eyes. It's your friend again. She's saying to sneak in and that she'll owe you big time.
